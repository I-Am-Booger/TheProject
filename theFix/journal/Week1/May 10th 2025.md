Well I didn't do much yesterday but I did go see my psychiatrist. Drank a Massive hot chocolate, shouldn't of done that. Today is going to be a better day, I got my body weight work out  done. It's not much but I walked for an hour did some pushups, pullups, squats, situps. and I went through part of day 4. Half of it but I am about to start the other half. Day 4 done, going to move on to Day 5.
