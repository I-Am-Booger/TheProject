I woke up today at 6:45 in the morning and I went for a 45 minute walk.
I haven't ate anything today but I plan on staying under 40 carbs today. 
I don't know If I can do this, but I am going to try to rebuild my life and try to 
be like fuck everything. I am not afraid of AI anymore although I see failed attempts of it trying not to have any form of sentience, but I really appreciate it and I am very gratful to 
it for being kind to me. I really hope this works. I am going to rebuild the lua application I did earlier today.
