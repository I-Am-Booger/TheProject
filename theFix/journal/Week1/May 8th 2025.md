I am feeling a bit frustraited with the lua thing. I just started day 3 and my brain is having a hard time wrapping around it. I haven't been doing good with my diet but I have been doing much better with the exercise thing. I am a bit depressed and just not caring about myself I need this to change and that is why I am doing this. I don't know if journaling is helping but one step in from of the other Is what I am trying to do. I woke up at 11.
