I woke up at 8:30, It's going to be a better week. Thursday I am going to start my trip to Mexico and It's going to be interesting. I have been off of the continent but never to another country. Hopefully I don't get cooked lol. Today I have had 16 carbs so far and I want to be at least under 100 but the lower the better. I have to go running here in a sec. I really don't want to do it but I need too. I can't try to get my wife to take better care of her self If I don't. I have been feeling a bit week lately. It kind of scares me about the whole cancer thing. A lot of my family gets it around my age and dies a bit early, Not a pleasant death, but if it does happen Cinthya will be set as long as she listens to me. I know she won't, she only does what she want's and the money will be gone after a bit but at least she will have a learning experience. I would rather her have 50 grand every year for the rest of her life. That's pretty good money for free. Anyway I am off for the day. First day I completed all the goals.
